## the type of tech factory modpack to play when you're busy with other things

I've gone through numerous amounts of modpacks, both custom-made and famous creator ones, however, it is hard to strike a balance between these three categories:

- lightweight - easy to load on laptops when you need a break but not at your main pc
- medium content - something that doesn't require GT:NH amount of time to complete the main tech
- endgame vanilla creative - endgame being focused on the ability to build whatever you want as if creative, but not being in creative

[Modern Industrialization](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modern-industrialization) satisfies the main technology part very well, with medium amount of time to reach the endgame of vanilla creative, while [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) and [AE2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-energistics-2) help with minor quality of life for resources and storage respectively.

There are an assortment of other mods to modify world generation, some items to explore for minimal exploration in the overworld, and quality of life changes to accelerate the early game extremely fast and speed up tick related blocks. 

Notably, these other specific mods have been added for their reasons:

- [Infinite Dimensions](https://modrinth.com/mod/infinite-dimensions) - technically infinite exploration, infinite number of random dimensions
- [Mekanism](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mekanism) - added literally just to get the cardboard box to transport flawless certus quartz crystal from AE2
- [Extreme Reactors](https://modrinth.com/mod/extreme-reactors) - alternative midgame high power generation for AE2

Building is the main endgame, but ideally it should be done in survival, but with a creative-infinite inventory.
